# Introduction

This booklet is a set of guides and resources for anyone in our lab working
on UVP Data.

Anyone working with the UVP needs to thorougly read throught the [UVP manual](https://sites.google.com/view/piqv/piqv-manuals/instruments-manuals)\

In this guide there are several resources for processing UVP data. First, there are specifics as to how projects should be configured. Next, there is a dictionary for UVP files and terms. There is also resources for connecting to the processing computer, transferring data, and more. 
Validation of vignettes should follow the [StoneLAB ID guide](#)
Analysis of UVP data is made easy with [EcotaxaTools](https://thealexbarth.github.io/Ecotaxa_Tools_Tutorial)



# Data Management:

UVP processing and data management can be broken down into four fundamental phases:

- [Project Configuration](#)
- [Local Processing](#)
- [Web Processing](#)
- [Data Processing](#)

Data products are shown in squares. These are color coded and shown inside a computer if located there.](./media/new_stat_07.png)


## A walk through the Data management plan:
Our data were previously acquired and moved between a set of external harddrives with no clear system
