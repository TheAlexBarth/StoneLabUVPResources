# StoneLabUVPResources

This is a set of resources for our lab to work on UVP data. This repo is a bit of a beast with a lot going on.

At the top level is an .Rproj with opens everything. -down the line this might not be needed.

Inside some of the new subdirectories, there are other .Rproj 's which are helpful to load environments with build tools configured to whatever you are actually working on in the moment.

There is an /R directory which holds useful r scripts. Notably, there is a package "StoneLabUVPTools"

-   This package is intended for local builds *only*.

-   It primarily hosts clean functions for meta-data entry

There is a meta-data entry pipeline Processing_QMD

-   These are qmd files which make entering meta-data on UVP projects easy and interactive

-   Note you should never save or render these scripts

There is a /Guides directory

-   This hosts all resources for documentation development

The /docs folder is for github hosting.
